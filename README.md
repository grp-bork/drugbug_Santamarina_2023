## Figures and supplementary results

This repository contains all code to generate the main and supplementary figures from the pre-processed data. (Pre-processing includes: determining relative species abundances from 16S sequencing data, determining AUCs from growth curves, processing metabolomics data.) All preprocessed data is in the `data` folder. Statistical analyses and figures are all in R, and can be invoked on the shell using the `Makefile` (`make`).
